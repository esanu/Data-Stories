# Homework II
Part 1
Graphic developed as a journalist: The target audience from this perspective are readers who have political views. I decided to highlight the increase in apprehensions at the border because of the ongoing political debate on immigration. This chart will appeal to both audiences for different reasons. First, those who have conservative views on immigration may view the increase in apprehensions as an indication of tougher enforcement. On the other hand, readers who have more liberal views may view the increase as one more thing to criticize the current administration for. To maintain a neutral position on this, I used neutral colors.

Border patrol apprehensions have more than doubled within the last year to nearly a quarter million when compared with the previous period. The largest increase is in the apprehension of children and family units.  The Department of Homeland Security reports to be at maximum capacity because of this dramatic increase in detainees, thus leading to overcrowding, prolonged detention and secruity concerns.


Part 2
Graphic developed from the perspective of a Department of Homeland Security analyst.
The target audience from this perspective is high-level policy-makers at DHS as well as other government agencies. Since this is the audience with the power to make a change (e.g. provide additional funding), I used a bright and alarming color (red) to influence action, particularly around funding and

Funding for ICE boarding is short by over 20% causing a backlog in transferring detainees from detention at Border Patrol to detention at ICE.
